# Getting Started
The FortiGate Security Appliance (FSA) 10Gbps is a single tenant (dedicated), high throughput (10Gbps) hardware firewall with next generation features, such as AntiVirus (AV), Intrusion Prevention (IPS) and web filtering.

This firewall can be configured to protect traffic on multiple VLANs for both public and private networks. In the Customer Portal it is referred to as a “Multi VLAN Firewall”.

As the demand for high-speed, in-cloud networks for enterprise grows, so does the customer need for securing workload and network. Big data, SAN, compute intensive servers, and highly scalable applications are pushing the bandwidth and network speed requirements for workloads in the cloud. IBM recognizes that security solutions must evolve with the new demands in order to offer efficient protection. IBM’s new high-end high-throughput firewall offering is perfect for large businesses and enterprises who need a reliable, powerful, consolidated way to manage and control high-speed network traffic in the cloud.

With the exception of IBM, no other cloud service provider currently offers hardware firewalls for robust perimeter security in the cloud. FortiGate Security Appliance 10Gbps allows our customers to grow their workload and networks in IBM Cloud.

**NOTE:** The FortiGate Security Appliance (FSA) 10Gbps is currently in Early Access Program.
