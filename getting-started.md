2. Give the firewall a name.
3. Select your datacenter and Pod from the menus. Availability is limited to select locations.
4. Choose to have a single FSA or enable failover protection with the High Availability option.
5. Choose from the list of Add-ons or bundle all of them together for a discounted price. The Order Summary box displays the updated information for your current order.
6. Review your selections on the right, check that you read the Third-Party Service Agreements, then click **Create**. The order is verified automatically.

When the provisioning process is complete, the new FSA appears in the [Firewalls list page](/docs/fortigate-10g?topic=fortigate-10g-viewing-a-list-of-firewalls). Click the FSA name to open the Firewall Details page. You will find the IP addresses, login username, and password for the device.
