{: shortdesc}

## What is the difference between Fortigate Security Appliance (FSA) 10 GBps and FSA 1 GBps? What about Virtual Router Appliance?
{: #differences}
{: faq}
{: support}

FSA 10G provides faster throughput compared to FSA 1G. It allows the customer to protect multiple VLANs (both private and public). More add-ons such as Anti-Virus (AV), Intrusion Prevention (IPS), and Web Filtering can be enabled on demand.

Virtual Router Appliance also protects multiple VLANs. However, Virtual Router Appliance does not provide Next Generation Firewall add-ons and purpose-built security processors.

{: #vlan}
{: faq}
{: support}

No, it is not possible to have an FSA 10G and a Network Gateway device to be associated with the same customer VLAN.

## Does this offering charge for private network connectivity?
{: #network}
{: faq}
{: support}

IBMÂ© offers private connectivity free of charge, which is one of the key differentiators in the marketplace.

## Is FSA 1 GBps also a multi-VLAN offering?
{: #multi-vlan}
