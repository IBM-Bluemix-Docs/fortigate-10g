# FAQs
The following are frequently asked questions when working with the Fortigate Security Appliance 10g firewall.

## What is the difference between Fortigate Security Appliance (FSA) 10G and FSA 1G? What about Virtual Router Appliance?

FSA 10G provides faster throughput compared to FSA 1G. It allows the customer to protect multiple VLANs (both private and public). Additional add-ons such as Anti-Virus (AV), Intrusion Prevention (IPS), and Web Filtering can be enabled on demand.

Virtual Router Appliance also protects multiple VLANs. However, Virtual Router Appliance does not provide Next Generation Firewall add-ons and purpose-built security processors.

## Can FSA 10G and a Network Gateway be associated with the same VLAN?

No, it is not possible to have a FSA 10G and a Network Gateway device to be associated with the same customer VLAN.

## Does this offering charge for private network connectivity?

IBM offers private connectivity free of charge, which is one of our key differentiators in the marketplace.

## Is FSA 1Gbps also a multi-VLAN offering?

No, only FSA 10Gbps supports multiple VLANs.

## Is FSA 10Gbps available in Federal data centers?

FSA 10Gbps is not currently available in Federal data centers.

## Can a FSA 10Gbps be used in place of a Virtual Router Appliance?

Yes.

## Do you plan to upgrade FSA 1G with the same capability of the FSA 10G appliance?

Not currently.

## Can the FSA 10Gbps span over multiple pods in a datacenter?

Not currently. FSA 10Gbps is only able to protect VLANs for the pod it is deployed in.
