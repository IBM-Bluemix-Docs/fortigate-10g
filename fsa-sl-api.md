# FortiGate Security Apliance 10Gbps SoftLayer provisioning API reference
{: #api-reference} 

The SoftLayer&reg; Application Programming Interface (API) is the development interface that gives developers and system administrators direct 
interaction with SoftLayer's backend system. 
{:shortdesc}

The SoftLayer API (SLAPI) powers many of the features in the Customer Portal, which 
typically means if an interaction is possible in the Customer Portal, it can also be run in the API. Because you can programmatically interact
with all portions of the SoftLayer environment within the API, you can use the API to automate tasks.

The SoftLayer API is a Remote Procedure Call system. Each call involves sending data towards an API endpoint and receiving structured data
in return. The format used to send and receive data with the SLAPI depends on which implementation of the API you choose. 

For more information about the SoftLayer API and how to get started with them see the following resources in the SoftLayer
