A FortiGate Security Appliance 10 Gbps can be cancelled immediately or on the anniversary date. Cancelling on the anniversary date will keep the firewall active until the beginning of the next billing period.
{: shortdesc}

Take the following steps to cancel a firewall:

1. Navigate to the Device Overview page by selecting the name of the firewall under the **Firewall Name** column.
2. Click the overflow menu and select **Cancel Device**.
3. Choose to either cancel immediately or on the anniversary date (next billing cycle).
4. Confirm your selection.

If the option to cancel a firewall is missing, then it is already being cancelled.

Downgrading from a High Availability to a Standalone server is not supported.
