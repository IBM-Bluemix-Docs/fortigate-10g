# Getting Help and Support

If you have problems or questions when using the Fortigate Security Appliance 10Gbps, you can get help by searching for information or by asking questions through one of the forums listed below. You can also open a support ticket.

When using the forums to ask a question, tag your question so that it is seen by the Bluemix development teams.

* If you have technical questions about Virtual Servers, post your question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=virtual-servers+ibm-bluemix) and tag your question with "ibm-bluemix" and "FSA-10G".
* For questions about the service and getting started instructions, use the [IBM developerWorks dW Answers](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/topics/virtual-servers.html?smartspace=bluemix) forum. Include the "FSA-10G" and "bluemix" tags.

See [Getting help](https://console-regional.eu-gb.bluemix.net/docs/support/index.html#getting-help) for more details about using the forums.

For information about opening an IBM support ticket, or about support levels and ticket severities, see [Contacting support](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/support/index.html#contacting-support).
